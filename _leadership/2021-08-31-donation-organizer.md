I had initiated and organized a donation event when I was on a long-term business trip to Singapore.

One of my colleagues was having chronic pain due to Ankylosing Spondylitis. The doctor suggested that the surgery to replace his hip joints would cost around 20 thousand dollars. However, the responsibility of raising his family prevented him from saving enough money for his treatment. The thing got worse after he spent all his saving on living.  

To help him out of the dilemma, I formed a team to find a way to cover the expense of the surgery and the living cost before he got recovered.  I launched a donation program, broadcast his situation to the colleague, and gathered a few volunteers to organize the donation event. I consulted the lawyer to get the information about the tax for the donation and privacy policy related to the donor in Singapore. I designated a group of volunteers to help him with the logistics stuff. We shared the work we did every week.

We recorded the detail of each donation in a list. At the end of the event, we collected around 4000 dollars. This event worked as a catalyzer that aroused the attention of the other communities. Eventually, the donation we received after that event met the needs, and my colleague received proper treatment on time.
