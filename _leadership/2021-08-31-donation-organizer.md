When I was on a long-term business trip to Singapore, I organized a successful donation event to help one of my colleagues who was suffering from Ankylosing Spondylitis and could not afford the surgery to replace his hip joints. With the help of a team I formed, we launched a donation program and broadcasted his situation to our colleagues. I consulted a lawyer to ensure the legality of the program in Singapore and designated volunteers to handle logistics.

We recorded the details of each donor and ultimately collected around 4000 dollars. This event garnered attention from other communities and, with the additional donations received, we were able to cover the cost of my colleague's surgery and living expenses until he recovered.
