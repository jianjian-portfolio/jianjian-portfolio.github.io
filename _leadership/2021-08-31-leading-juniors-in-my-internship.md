Being a lead data scientist intern, the company acknowledged my leadership via this referral letter.

The company needed data scientists to build an NLP-related application. I was designated to be the team lead intern in my department. There are 2 data scientists, 2 data engineers, and a biology expert in the team. 

This project is to devise a process of mining values from its patient acquisitions. Those patients were all related to the genetic of all species. There was a load of patients in the data warehouse. We need to find an efficient way to build an online analyzing system. 

Firstly, I scheduled a weekly meeting to be the first work of this project. In the meeting, we brainstormed the solution to the problem and compared different technologies. After the first meeting, the team concluded that the project was to build a recommender system based on the graphical computation. Thus, we experimented with many rounds of POC (proof of concept) prototyping and decided to use BERT pre-trained model to carry out the NER (name entity recognition) task.  

We used Microsoft Teams to collaborate remotely during the pandemic. To collaborate with the subject experts, I suggested the team to consulting her for feedback before the next developing cycle. Also, I conducted one-on-one mentoring to the members on the way to research efficiently. Later, I integrated the work to deliver a quality product. 

This project bridged the gap between the field of engineering and data science. It helped the company to clear the path of development for the next step.
