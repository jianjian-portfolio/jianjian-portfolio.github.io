Being a lead data scientist intern, the company acknowledged my leadership via this referral letter.

The company was in need of data scientists to build an NLP-related application. I was designated to be the team lead intern in my department. There are 2 data scientists, 2 data engineers, and 1 biology expert in the team. 

The team was requested to devise a process of mining values from its patient acquisitions. Those patients were all related to the genetic of all species. There was a huge load of patients in the data warehouse and we need to find an efficient way to build an online analyzing system. 

Firstly, I scheduled a weekly meeting to be the first work of this project. In the meeting, we brainstormed the solution to the problem and compared different technologies. After the first meeting, the team concluded that the project was to build a recommender system based on the graphical computation. We used the Microsoft teams to collaborate remotely during the pandemic. 

To collaborate with the subject experts, in each developing cycle, I suggested the team consulting her for feedback. Also, I conducted one-on-one mentoring to the members on the way to make efficient research. Later, I integrated the work to deliver a quality product. 

This project bridged the gap between the field of engineering and that in data science. It helped the company to clear the path of development for the next step.
