<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 16px"><i>A recommendation letter from Jonas Block, Head of AI Development</i></p>
As the lead data scientist intern, I was tasked with overseeing a team of two data scientists, two data engineers, and a biology expert to develop an NLP-related application for the company. The project aimed to mine patient data related to genetics to build an efficient online analyzing system.

To accomplish this, I organized weekly meetings where we brainstormed solutions and compared different technologies. After experimenting with various POC prototypes, we decided to use a BERT pre-trained model to carry out the NER task for building a recommender system based on graphical computation.

I facilitated remote collaboration using Microsoft Teams during the pandemic and encouraged the team to consult the subject expert for feedback before the next development cycle. Additionally, I provided one-on-one mentoring to team members to research more efficiently.

The project helped bridge the gap between engineering and data science and cleared the path for the company's future development. My leadership was recognized by the company through this referral letter.
