During my time at NEC Corporation (China), I had the privilege of leading and mentoring a team of ten contract engineers who provided production support in Beijing and Shanghai.

As the team consisted of sub-contractors from various companies with varying levels of technical skill, it was impossible to provide one-on-one mentoring. However, I developed an on-job-training project to enhance their skills and monitor the status of the cluster.

To ensure the team's productivity, I analyzed pending tasks and assigned new members to this new project. The project served as a training ground that allowed members to detect system defaults in a cluster environment while polishing their skills.

Despite the challenges, my team successfully identified 36 bugs, which is 1.79% of the total test cases, within the contract period. The client was impressed with our work, and we received positive feedback.
