I was honored to leading and mentoring the contract engineers on-site at NEC corporation(China). I led a group of 10 members in Beijing and Shanghai to provide production support.

The members of this team were all sub-contractors who came from different companies. The level of their technical skills varied from one to another. It is impossible to provide one-on-one mentoring. However, the client requested us to finish the testing task within five weeks. So, to cope with the team's productivity, after analyzed pending tasks, I assigned the new members with a brand-new project which aimed to monitor the status of the cluster. 

The internal project served as an OJT(on-job-training) project that polished the skills of the members. Meanwhile, it assisted the team in detecting the system default in a cluster environment. 

The client was pretty satisfied with our works. At the end of the contract, my team successfully identified 36 bugs, which is 1.79% of the total test cases.
