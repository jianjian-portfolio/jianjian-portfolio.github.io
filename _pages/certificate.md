Welcome to my portfolio website. I am Jian Jian. I just finished my master's degree in Applied Data Science at Syracuse University. Before I came to my school, I was a Senior Java Software Engineer with 12 years of experience in e-commerce, health care, web portal, as well as in the offshore finance sector. I also have many practices in microservice architecture design and agile development. To promote my career to the next level, I started my plan for my continuing education 3 years ago.
