Welcome to my portfolio website. I am Jian Jian, a data science and deep learning scientist at Deepcell. As a specialist in artificial intelligence, I am adept in advanced artificial intelligence, such as big data, deep learning, computer vision, NLP, regression analysis, and predictive modeling. In my past projects, I reconciled machine learning and deep learning methods with software engineering, which empowered life sciences, intellectual property management, medical research, social information science, and other industries. Along with their vision, I helped my client invent A.I. algorithms to turn their imaginations into applications. 

My career started 14 years ago. I got my bachelorâ€™s degree in economics in 2008. Since I learned Java myself at school, I chose to be a software engineer after my graduation. The industry was growing, which offered me the opportunities to apply machine learning methods in my past projects. During that period, I developed my unique way to familiarize myself with this fast-growing industry. To systematically understand how artificial intelligence works, I joined a highly selected research lab at Syracuse University. When preparing my machine learning paper in the research lab, I obtained my master's degree in data science during that period. As a life learner, I put my decades of savings into my master's studies in data science to fulfill my curiosity. 

My research interest is 'science of science'. This track combines deep learning with machine learning methods to explain phenomenons during the research. The work included building a search engine to help other researchers to find correlated papers, inventing open-source software to help the other scientists to spin up their works, detecting tampered images in a research paper, which is a critical topic of research integrity, etc.

Besides the role I play in the real world. I was a WOWer for more than 7 years. I feel it is a kind of pre-metaverse before we officially bring the metaverse into a definition. As a human protection paladin, I led a guild of 50 active members on holding events. I had quit that game for almost 8 years already. But I still fight FOR THE ALLIANCE!

Also, I started to play badminton when I was 3. I haven't played it for almost 2 years since the pandemic. I wish everything goes better this year.
