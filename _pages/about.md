Welcome to my portfolio website. I am Jian Jian. I just finished my master's degree in Applied Data Science at Syracuse University. Before I came to my school, I was a Senior Java Software Engineer with 12 years of experience in e-commerce, health care, web portal, as well as in the offshore finance sector. I also have many practices in microservice architecture design and agile development. To promote my career to the next level, I started my plan for my continuing education 3 years ago. 

For the past few months, I was working on my internship in a company as a data scientist to help the customer to minging values from their intellectual properties. On the other hand, I also worked in a research lab to experiment with a variety of machine learning methods. I have a paper under preparation. And it is expected to be published around this summer. 

Since I have many years of backend Java engineering experience. I am proficient in Java. In the previous project, I successfully integrated the Spring Boot with the middleware component to build a distributed system. 

My research interest is on machine learning methods and artificial neural networks.
