Welcome to my portfolio website! I am Jian Jian, a machine learning and deep learning generalist at Deepcell. As an artificial intelligence specialist, I am experienced in working with big data, deep learning, computer vision, NLP, regression analysis, and predictive modeling. In my past projects, I have applied machine learning and deep learning techniques to various fields, including life sciences, intellectual property management, medical research, and social information science, helping clients to turn their ideas into reality. 

My career began 14 years ago when I obtained my bachelor's degree in economics. Since then, I have worked as a Java software engineer, and I have been fortunate enough to explore the field of machine learning. To deepen my understanding of this rapidly evolving field, I joined a selective research lab at <a href="https://scienceofscience.org/people/">SOS+CD Laboratory</a> and earned my master's degree in data science. As a lifelong learner, I invested heavily in my education to satisfy my curiosity. 

My research interests lie in the intersection of deep learning and machine learning methods. I have developed a range of tools to help researchers discover correlations between papers, create open-source software to facilitate research, and detect tampered images in research papers, which is an essential topic in research integrity.

In addition to my real-world responsibilities, I spent over seven years immersed in the MMORPG game - World of Warcraft (WoW). To me, it felt like a precursor to the metaverse, a world that has since come to be recognized as a distinct concept. In WoW, I played as a human protection paladin, leading a guild of 50 active members and organizing various events. Although it's been almost ten years since I left the game, I continue to cherish the memories I gained during my time in Azeroth. And I still fight FOR THE ALLIANCE!

I started playing badminton when I was three years old. Due to the pandemic, I have not played for almost three years, but I hope to resume playing this year.
