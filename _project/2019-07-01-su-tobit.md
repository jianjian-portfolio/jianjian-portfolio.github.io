This paper discussed the determinants of publications' reproducibility. We experimented with classic machine learning techniques to set a baseline, such as linear regression, lasso, ridge, elastic net regression, as well as the logistic regression and random forest.

In this paper, we advanced the Tobit censored regression model using the MAP(maximum a posteriori). 

Tobit regression assumes that there are 2 latent variables on the left and right-hand sides which cannot be directly observed. So the model uses maximum likelihood estimation to approximate the relationship between the features and the target variable.

To promote the generalization ability of the model, I devised a method to attach an elastic net regularization term to the original censored regression model. To be more specific, I used the combination of gaussian and laplacian distribution as the prior probability to estimate the parameter of the Tobit model. Then the prior probability can work as an elastic net to increase the model's generalization ability. And I used bootstrap aggregation to extract the feature importance multiple times to get a robust rank with regards to their estimations.
