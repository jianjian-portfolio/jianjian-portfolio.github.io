This in-house project was written in Java. The kit checked the survival status of nodes in the cluster by inspecting the returns of the command ping. The program will notify the maintenance by email if any nodes stop responding to the heartbeat signal. 

In this project, I led a team of 5 to collaborate on project development. I participated in the design, implementation, code review, testing, and release to the environment.
