As the senior Java software engineer, I was responsible for mentoring junior team members, performing code reviews, and overseeing project development. Using the Wacom pad platform, I developed the e-signature module, which converted invoice pictures into Base64 encoded strings for HTML5 visualization. The module captured signature curves via an e-pencil, promoting a seamless and user-friendly experience for patients.

To further optimize the system's performance, I introduced a backend cache to accelerate signature loading in pages, further enhancing the user experience. My contributions played a crucial role in the success of the project, ultimately ensuring that the Mount Alvernia Hospital could deliver high-quality patient care services.
