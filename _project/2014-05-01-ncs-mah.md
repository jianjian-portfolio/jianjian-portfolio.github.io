The client of this project is Mount Alvernia Hospital in Singapore. It offers patient admission and miscellaneous medical information management service to meet the patientsâ€™ expectations.

I was in charge of mentorship for the juniors, code reviews, and project development. Based on the Wacom pad platform, I developed the module e-signature. It converted the invoice picture into a Base64 encoded string for HTML5 visualization. The program captured the signature curve via e-pencil. To accelerate the signature loading in pages, I introduced a backend cache to the system to promote the user experience.
