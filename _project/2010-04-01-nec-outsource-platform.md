As a team lead, my responsibilities included both people management and technical mentorship for on-site team members. In particular, I provided guidance and support for a team of 30 colleagues in Beijing and 10 colleagues in Shanghai, focusing on testing customer applications.

Thanks to the expertise and dedication of my team, we were able to successfully detect 1.79 bugs per kilobyte for each release, contributing to the overall quality and reliability of the applications we were responsible for testing.

Throughout my tenure as team lead, I remained committed to supporting and empowering my team members, helping them to develop their skills and achieve their professional goals. Together, we were able to achieve outstanding results and make a significant contribution to the success of the organization.
