The development of ImageAnnotatorJS, a JavaScript library designed to assist frontend engineers in creating an annotating system, was partially funded by the Office of Research Integrity, Department of Health and Human Services of the United States through grants ORIIIR190049 and ORIIR180041. The library allows users to annotate shapes onto the HTML5 canvas, facilitating image analysis and providing important data for research purposes. With its simple and user-friendly interface, ImageAnnotatorJS is a powerful tool for researchers and developers alike, enabling them to quickly and accurately annotate images for a variety of applications.

By providing this library to the research community, we hope to support and promote the development of new tools and techniques for image analysis, as well as to encourage collaboration and data sharing among researchers. With its ease of use and versatility, ImageAnnotatorJS has the potential to facilitate new discoveries and insights in a wide range of fields, from biomedical research to machine learning and computer vision.
