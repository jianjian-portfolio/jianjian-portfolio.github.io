This is a PoC (Proof of Concept) project for a knowledge graph system that aims to analyze and extract genetic information from unstructured text files.

I managed a team of 3 as a leader to plan and work out the research idea. Also, I am responsible for the working progress of my subordinate and reviewing their project design. The team developed a data pipeline to extract the gene name, sequence, and organism name out of patients. We integrated the ETL pipeline with the BLAST+ database to classify the taxonomy category of the genetic information. This project consolidated the intellectual acquisition with other information to build a next-level business value.
