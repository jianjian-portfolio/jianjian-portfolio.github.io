This application serves as a platform for receiving requests for company registration from agencies around the world.

As a developer on the project, my responsibilities included working on extension development and evaluating changes to the browser compatibility task. To complete these tasks, I utilized Java as the primary programming language, analyzing the codebase to scan JSP and JavaScript files and highlight problematic code chunks.

This analysis helped the team better understand and estimate the scope and risk level of the task at hand, ultimately leading to the successful completion of the project. My contributions played a crucial role in ensuring that the application could provide high-quality services for agencies worldwide.
