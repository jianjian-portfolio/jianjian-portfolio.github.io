My responsibilities as a senior Java software engineer included developing extensions using EJB 2, Struts1, and iBATIS. One of my primary contributions was optimizing the function of database pagination by utilizing clustered indexing in Oracle.

This optimization significantly improved the system's performance, enhancing the user experience for medical staff and patients alike. Overall, my contributions played an essential role in ensuring the success of the system and its ability to provide high-quality patient care services.
