This e-commerce project integrates the merchant API to offer the quotation and ordering service to the other applications. I am responsible for developing new features to meet requests from the business team. This project is developing rapidly. I redesigned the API to offer the payment service a more convenient way to proceeding its transaction. I led a group of 2 members to implement the tracking log module to facilitate the troubleshooting process, and we introduced a subsystem to help the business analytic team to do the AB TEST. 

On the other hand, I conceptualize and devised the token bucket algorithm to coordinate the backpressure signal from the third party service. And I integrated MongoDB change stream with functional programming to promote the system performance to the next level. Eventually, the throughput of the system is able to reach 300 transactions per second. This is the first time I applied the statistical analysis on the production environment.
