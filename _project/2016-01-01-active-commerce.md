This e-commerce project seamlessly integrates the merchant API to provide quotation and ordering services to other applications. As the senior Java engineer, I am responsible for developing new features to meet business team requests and ensure the project's rapid growth.

To improve the user experience, I redesigned the API to provide a more convenient payment service and led a team of two to implement the tracking log module, which greatly facilitated troubleshooting processes. Additionally, we introduced a subsystem to help the business analytics team perform AB tests.

To address issues with backpressure signals from third-party services, I conceptualized and devised the token bucket algorithm. To further optimize system performance, I integrated MongoDB change stream with functional programming, increasing the system's throughput to 300 transactions per second.

I also implemented statistical analysis in the production environment for the first time, further improving the system's overall performance. Overall, my contributions played a critical role in ensuring the success of this rapidly developing project.
