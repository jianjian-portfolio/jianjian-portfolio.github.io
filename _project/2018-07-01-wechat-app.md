This POC project was developed for China Huaneng Shanxi Qingling Power Generation to predict electrical output. As the principal architect, I was responsible for overseeing the development of the application. I worked closely with the engineering director of the power plant to understand their requirements and ensure that the application was designed to meet their needs.

The application integrated a REST service with its frontend to enable users to query and visualize the predicted electrical output. We used the WeChat Micro App platform as the front end, which allowed users to access the application easily through their mobile devices. To ensure that the application was robust and reliable, we conducted extensive testing and validation throughout the development process.

Overall, this POC project was successful in demonstrating the feasibility of using machine learning to predict electrical output. The application we developed provided accurate predictions and a user-friendly interface, which was well-received by the power plant's engineering team. Based on the success of this project, we are now exploring opportunities to further develop and deploy this application in other power plants.
