This is a market research project for Airbnb. In this project, I employed statistical approaches to explore text reviews from Airbnb customers. I adapted BERT pre-trained model, using Natural Languagling Processing to differentiate customers' preferences. Also, I fine-tuned machine learning methods to identify behaviors among user groups in sharing economy market.

- This is an ongoing project.
