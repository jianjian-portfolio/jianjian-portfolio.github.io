This is a market research project for Airbnb. In this project, I employed statistical approaches to explore text reviews from Airbnb customers. I adapted BERT pre-trained model, using Natural Languagling Processing to differentiate customers' preferences. Also, I fine-tuned machine learning methods to identify behaviors among user groups in sharing economy market.

As a data scientist, I collaborated with the company AirDNA to study the disruption and macro-level impact of short-term rentals in the regional sharing economy market. AirDNA was the leading provider of data and analytics for the $140B short-term rental industry. Based on customer reviews and the revenue history, my analysis offered AirDNA insights into the short-term rental market. I leveraged and experimented with the dataset using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), Principle Component Analysis (PCA), Factor Analysis (FA), Generalized Linear Regression (GLR), Latent Dirichlet Analysis (LDA), and other analytical models. I evaluated the degree of trust from customers over hosts on the Airbnb platform, which shed light on property owners to the way of fighting against the market uncertainty after the pandemic.
