<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 16px"><i>The structural equation modeling</i></p>
In this market research project for Airbnb, I employed statistical approaches to explore text reviews from customers, collaborating with the company AirDNA to study the disruption and macro-level impact of short-term rentals in the sharing economy market. As a data scientist, I fine-tuned machine learning methods and leveraged various analytical models to identify behaviors among user groups and offer insights into the short-term rental market.

Using Natural Language Processing and the BERT pre-trained model, I differentiated customersâ€™ preferences and evaluated the degree of trust from customers over hosts on the Airbnb platform. My analysis, which included Structural Equation Modeling, Principle Component Analysis, Factor Analysis, Generalized Linear Regression, and Latent Dirichlet Analysis, shed light on property owners to the way of fighting against the market uncertainty after the pandemic. The insights I provided to AirDNA helped them understand the market and offer valuable data and analytics to the short-term rental industry.
