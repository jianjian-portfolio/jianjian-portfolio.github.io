This AI platform allows researchers to characterize tissue composition at the cellular level by sorting cells based on morphology and supporting downstream analysis. As a senior machine learning engineer, I employed preemptible TPU to train the model. To make use of all the morphological features, I created an index system to make the petabytes of legacy embeddings compatible with the latest architecture of the deep learning network. Also, I devised a data pipeline that reads the image data captured by an in-house instrument, loads the raw data from NAS to GCS, applies it with computer vision augmentation, and pre-processes it into Tensorflow embeddings. The system assists bioscientists and other cross-functional teams in researching and exploring neo cell cluster types.
