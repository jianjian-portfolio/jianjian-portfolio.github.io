As a senior machine learning engineer, I played a crucial role in the development of an AI platform that enables researchers to analyze and classify cellular tissue composition by sorting and analyzing cell morphology. I worked with data scientists to fine-tune deep neural models on the Google Cloud Platform, utilizing various network architectures to sort, clean, and classify cell images. To optimize computational resources, I utilized preemptible TPUs and developed a hyperparameter tuning tool for scheduling and monitoring training performance. I also implemented TensorRT and ONNX model formats for model compression and translation, built a model management service, and created an index system to make petabytes of legacy embeddings compatible with the latest deep learning network architecture. Moreover, I designed a data pipeline that reads image data captured by an in-house instrument, applies computer vision augmentation, and pre-processes it into Tensorflow embeddings. Our solution integrates a proprietary instrument with cloud computing resources, aiding biologists and cross-functional teams in researching and exploring novel cell cluster types.
